# Shift-Ctrl-Space Website

This is a [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository containing the source code used for the [ShiftCtrl.space](https://shiftctrl.space/) website.

> Shift-Ctrl-Space is a keyboard command that, in numerous word processing applications such as LibreOffice Writer, Microsoft Word, and even Dreamweaver, inserts a literal non-breaking space character. This is a true Unicode character with its own registered code point: U+00A0. The non-breaking space looks identical to a regular space, with one important distinction. When displayed correctly, the non-breaking space tells the renderer not to collapse multiple extents of this specific character in whitespace into one regular space. 
>
> This makes the non-breaking space character effectively invisible when on its own, but gives it a very pronounced and visible behavior when they are grouped together. 
>
> This is how we make space to shift control from dystopic nightmares of surveillance capitalism to a more holistic, optimistic technological future. 
>
> Welcome to Shift-Ctrl-Space.
