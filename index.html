                <p><strong>I/O is an autonomous technology project.</strong> We connect grassroots organizations, nonprofits, and community members with free resources on technology, including info sessions, educational materials, and workshops.</p>
                <p>Each week, we set a space where we as individuals and small organizations become more aware of the power in our everyday tech and personal devices, and practice utilizing that power <strong>for the betterment of our lives and communities</strong>.</p>
                <p>Our events are <strong>free to attend, with a suggested donation of $10</strong>.</p>
                <p>Here you will find links to helpful resources, as well as <a href="#io-calendar">instructions on how to subscribe to our calendar of events</a>.</p>

            <section id="io-programs">
                <h2>Our Programs</h2>
                <p>We host programs <strong>(nearly) every Sunday from <time datetime="14:00">2</time>&ndash;<time datetime="18:00">6pm</time></strong> at <a href="https://www.thefootlightbar.nyc/">The Footlight</a>, located at  <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/search?query=465%20Seneca%20Avenue%2C%20Ridgewood%2C%20Queens%2C%20NY%2011385">465 Seneca Avenue in Ridgewood, Queens, New York</a>. We alternate between programming that is generally oriented towards Individuals (I) and programming that is generally oriented towards organizations (O) or collectives.</p>
                <p>Of course, anyone can attend either type of gathering &mdash; this distinction is made only to help you scope what you would like to attend, and the things you would like to learn. When the topic appeals to both, the event will be marked &ldquo;I/O.&rdquo;</p>
            </section>

            <section id="io-ethos">
                <h2>Our Ethos</h2>
                <p>In computing, <dfn>I/O</dfn> is short for &ldquo;input/output,&rdquo; and is used regularly across a variety of contexts, but most often refers to some kind of exchange between external devices and internal devices, or, moreover, between machines and humans. It is this very exchange we concern ourselves with. &ldquo;Io&rdquo; is also the name of Jupiter&rsquo;s innermost moon. The moon was named after a mortal figure in Greek mythology, who befriends imprisoned Prometheus, and whose descendent, Heracles, eventually frees him.</p>
                <p>Our programs are <strong><em>not</em></strong> part of a &ldquo;bootcamp&rdquo; or coding school. We are <strong><em>not</em></strong> recruiters. We actively discourage everyone from getting into the so-called &ldquo;Tech Industry.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>We <em>are</em> anti-technocapitalists, solarpunks, and radical technologists. Our ethics place us <em>against</em> &ldquo;Adtech,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fintech,&rdquo; and Silicon Valley.</p>
                <p>We <strong><em>do</em></strong> believe <strong>technology is an intangible earth</strong>, with which we can and should have an earthly relationship. It <strong><em>is</em></strong> power that we can harness through holistic methods as individuals and cooperative networks for <strong>the empowerment of oneself and of one&rsquo;s  actual communities</strong>.</p>
                <p>Our approach stands in contrast to isolationism, sterility, and authoritarianism by being <strong>participatory, flexible, and adaptive</strong>. If you are employed by organizations in the Tech Industry, please be advised that <strong>our ideology is hostile to Tech Industry profit motives.</strong></p>
                <p>We have a strict <strong>no-tolerance policy against bigotry of any kind</strong>. Racism, queerphobia, transphobia, sexism, or any kind of similarly awful behavior will result in immediate removal from the venue and you will not be asked back. Starting arguments that hijack the experience of others or make other people feel less able to learn will result in the same, and this includes being condescending to others.</p>

                            We will harness some of this power to share a two-way livestream with our friends in Pittsburgh, who are hosting a mini-conference on biohacking called &ldquo;<a href="https://pleasetrythispgh.wordpress.com/2018/02/14/queer-cyborgs-wanted/" title="A Collaborative Conference on Radical Bodily Autonomy & Biotechnology" class="u-url url">Please Try This at Home</a>.&rdquo;
                            There will also be opportunities to meet and talk with fellow participants about their own interests and projects. Come with questions, and bring a laptop or your smartphone to experience first-hand a glimpse into a more optimistic, holistic technological future.
